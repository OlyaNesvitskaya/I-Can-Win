Welcome to the internet, we're living in a meme
Digital avatars, hide behind their screens
You can see it in your mentions
We got demons in the comment section
Screaming for redemption
'Cause they don't get enough attention

Welcome to the inter-inter-inter-inter-internet
Try to be mean to me 'cause you don't think with intellect
Everybody spreading fingers, listen to the people of
Hiding on the internet are always talking trash
